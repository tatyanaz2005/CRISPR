  <h1> CRISPR Gene Editing<br> A Public Service Announcement</h1>
<div id="Info" name="Info" class="Info">
  <p id="Intro"> Imagine a world where gene editing was fast, cheap, and easy. Imagine a world where we could stop diseases, have eternal youth, and have children so smart that they keep making revolutionary discoveries. This is now all possible with a new technology called CRISPR. Using Cas9’s cut-and-paste technique, discovered by Jennifer Doudna and her team. </p>
<h3>Curing Diseases</h3>
  <p id="diseases"> Due to the fact that CRISPR can cut out snippets of DNA that were detected as viruses, it has the potential to cure many diseases. In 2015, scientists were able to use CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of cells, proving that getting rid of diseases with CRISPR is possible. About a year later, scientists got access to rats that had the HIV virus in almost all of their cells. By just injecting the rats with CRISPR, they were able to remove over 50% of the HIV DNA in the rats’ bodies’ cells. This technique would also work with other retroviruses such as Aids, and Herpes. Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while hiding themselves from the immune system. Using CRISPR, scientists can modify your immune cells and make it easier for them to find cancer. Eventually, we may be able to cure cancer by getting an injection of a few thousand of your own cells that have been edited in a lab to heal you. The first trial for a CRISPR Cancer treatment on a human was approved in early 2016 in the United States. Not even a month later, Chinese scientists revealed that they would treat lung cancer patients with immune cells that they modified using CRISPR during August 2016. Over 3 000 genetic diseases are caused by one incorrect letter in your DNA, and people are already working on a version of Cas9 that can change a single letter in your DNA, thus curing these diseases. </p>
<h3> Genetically Modified Embyros</h3>
  <p id="Perfection"> Though the technology to edit the gene pool of an embryo is in it’s very early stages, it exists, and has been attempted twice, once in 2015, and once in 2016, the second time being partially successful. Their attempts show that scientists still have many struggles to fix when it comes to gene modification, but that it is possible. CRISPR gene modification on an embryo will probably start just by eliminating a genetic disease that runs in the family, but eventually it will become more and more popular, and eventually people will probably be using this technique to give their child things like perfect eyesight, enhanced metabolism, and any other traits that can help the child. Because of the low prices of CRISPR, this technology will be accessible to more people than just the millionaires. </p>
<h3> A Possible Cure For Ageing</h3>
  <p id="Age"> Currently, out of the approximately 150 000 people who have passed away today, ⅔ of them have passed due to age-related causes. Right now, we think that ageing occurs because of the accumulated damage that our cells have. Using CRISPR, in the future, we may be able to stop ageing, or reverse it. We know from nature that there are animals that do not age (such as lobsters), and we may be able to borrow a few genes for ourselves. Some scientists even think that biological ageing could be something that at some point won’t even be a thing. Of course, we would still pass eventually, but instead of doing so in hospitals at the age of ninety, we could possibly live for a few thousand years. Even if technology is not this advanced in our time, it is possible that our generation is the first to use gene modification, to increase our lifespans. </p>

  <p id="conclusion">
    Whether you think that gene editing is great, or that it should be banned, it will affect us all. Genetically modified DNA will be passed down through generations, and may eventually change our species for the better, making us healthier, less affected by ageing, stronger, and smarter.
